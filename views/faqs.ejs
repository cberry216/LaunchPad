            <p class="question"><strong>Q: Why are some launches shaded green, yellow, blue, or red?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer"><strong>A: </strong>The color of a launch indicates its status. A launch that has a determined date and time is considered GO (green), 
            otherwise it is NO GO (yellow). A launch that was successful is a SUCCESS (blue) and one that did not is FAILED (red).</p>

            <p class="question"><strong>Q: Why is one of the launches blinking blue to red?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer"><strong>A: </strong>If a launch is in progress the timer turns into a T+ timer (time since launch) and the launch in progress is indicated by blinking blue to red.</p>

            <hr/>
            <p class="question"><strong>Q: Why is the latest launch not showing up in Past Launches?</strong></p>
